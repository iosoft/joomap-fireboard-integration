*Installation*

  # Hope you have already installed Fireboard/Kunena and Joomap and both of them working fine.
  # Download the _fireboard.plugin.php_ file.
  # put the file _fireboard.plugin.php_ in */administrator/*components/com_joomap/plugins/

That's it. The plug-in should start working. You should see Fireboard's Topics and Categories in Joomap.
